# Stock-Market-Analysis-Tool

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project used to predict the closing stock prices for Apple, Google and Microsoft in the first quarter of 2024, using sequential models. The project implements data visualizations using Plotly and Dash to monitor the variation in financial data over the past few years, which are displayed on a React application.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this problem are:
   - To compare the final closing prices for the companies and select which company would be the best to invest in based on previous prices.
   - To evaluate the performance of these models in performing stock analysis.
   - To visualize stock trends and financial shifts in companies over a large time period.

## Requirements
Ensure  you have the following dependencies installed:
   - Python 3.x
   - yfinance
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - requests
   - plotly
   - seaborn
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn
   - vaderSentiment
   - dash
   - tensorflow

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rotimi779/Stock-Market-Analysis-Tool.git
cd Stock-Market-Analysis-Tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use this repository, follow the following steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rotimi779/Stock-Market-Analysis-Tool.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Stock-Market-Analysis-Tool
```
3.Start Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4.For the react application, navigate to the data-analysis-app directory, then run the following commands
```bash
cd data-analysis-app
npm start
```

## Evaluation
The performance of each of the models are evaluated using the mean absolute error and the mean squared error.
- Mean absolute error(MAE): The average of the absolute value of difference between actual and predicted values.
- Mean squared error(MSE): The average of the squared difference between actual and predicted values.
